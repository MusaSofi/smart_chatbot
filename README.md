# Smart Student Support Chatbot

Smart Student Support Chatbot is an AI-powered assistant designed to provide students with quick and accurate information about curriculum details, faculty members, and various academic resources. These resources include data from the university portal u:find, which provides curriculum information as well as a directory of persons and organizations, subunits, and research groups (including contact details, addresses, websites, and team structures). Additionally, the chatbot will provide information about the faculty dean's office (contact details, address, team), professors and staff (contact details, addresses, positions, and subjects they teach), as well as the Student Service Center for Computer Science, which offers insights into study programs, research activities, news, events, and faculty-related updates.
