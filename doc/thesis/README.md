# Bachelor Thesis

You can use this folder her for the collection of relevant literature and all files related to your thesis.

I highly recommend that you follow the [guideline "Vorbereitung und Durchführung"](https://informatik.univie.ac.at/studium/hilfe-fuer-studierende/bachelorarbeit-empfehlungen/) on the faculty website. This guideline covers essential information about workload, implementation requirements, milestones, progress reports, meetings, final presentations, submission deadlines, suggested timelines, and grading. You can also find additional information about the grading in the [repository's assessment folder](/doc/assessment/README.md).

Furthermore, the [guideline "Struktur einer Bachelorarbeit"](<(https://informatik.univie.ac.at/studium/hilfe-fuer-studierende/bachelorarbeit-empfehlungen/)>) provides valuable information about the structure of the thesis and what to include in each section. The factsheet summarizes the structure, and you can find latex, word templates, and Overleaf templates in the templates section at the bottom of the page.

For writing your thesis, I suggest using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), free for Univie students. Once you have created your thesis in Overleaf, please remember to share your work with me.

In addition to the guidelines from the Faculty of Computer Science above, you may also get some valuable information at the website of the Center of Teaching and Learning [Bachelor Thesis Survival Guide Handreichung für Studierende](https://ctl.univie.ac.at/angebote-fuer-studierende/ressourcen/bachelor-thesis-survival-guide/)
