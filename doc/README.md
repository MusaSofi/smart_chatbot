# Documentation

Project documentation is essential because it records project-related information such as plans, requirements, schedules, and decisions. It provides a clear picture of project scope, goals, and deliverables and helps track progress, identify issues, and make informed decisions. Good documentation facilitates communication and collaboration among all stakeholders and ensures everyone is on the same page and working toward the same goals. It also helps minimize risk and improve the quality of the final product by providing a reliable reference point for future work. Overall, project documentation is critical to successful project management as it ensures that projects are completed on time, within (time) budget, and to the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

This directory structure includes the following folders:

```
.
├── final report                            # contains all the information related to the final report
├── presentation                            # contains information and files about your (final) presentation
├── project definition                      # contains all information about the project definition
.
```

In addition to the standard documentation practices, this project also leverages GitLab issues for continuous and interactive documentation. We will utilize issues to meticulously document e.g., meeting notes, status reports. This approach ensures that our documentation is current and provides an interactive platform for collaboration.
